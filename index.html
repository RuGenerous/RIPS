  Rugenerous Improvement Proposals (RIPs) describe standards for the Rugenerous platform,
  including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.

    Add your RIP to your fork of the repository. There is a
    <a href="https://github.com/rugenerous/RIPS/blob/master/rip-X.md"
      >template RIP here</a
    >.

  <li>
    Submit a Pull Request to Rugenerous's
    <a href="https://github.com/rugenerous/RIPS">RIPs repository</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Your first PR should be a first draft of the final RIP. It must meet the
  formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the
  header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new RIP and assign
  it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a
  <code>discussions-to</code> header with the URL to a discussion forum or open
  GitHub issue where people can discuss the RIP as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  If your RIP requires images, the image files should be included in a
  subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that RIP as follow:
  <code>assets/rip-X</code> (for rip <b>X</b>). When linking to an image in the
  RIP, use relative links such as <code>../assets/rip-X/image.png</code>.
</p>
<p>
  When you believe your RIP is mature and ready to progress past the WIP phase,
  you should ask to have your issue added to the next governance call where it
  can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community
  agrees to include it, the RIP editors will update the state of your RIP to
  <code>Approved</code>.
</p>
